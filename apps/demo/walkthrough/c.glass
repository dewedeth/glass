// edit the `model` attribute below to use an anthropic model â€” e.g. `claude-instant-v1`
// then, enter some text and run the glass file (command+return)

<Chat model="claude-instant-v1">

</Chat>

// anthropic actually doesn't support System blocks via their API
// so switching to the `claude-instant-v1` model will trigger a diagnostic (aka "red squiggle")

// the glass language will guide you to use the models (and their varying APIs) correctly
