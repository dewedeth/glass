// Let's try a `Chat` tag instead of a `User` tag`

// enter some text in the Chat element and run the `Glass: run file` command
// you can do this by using the VSCode command menu (like we did before)
// or by just pressing `⌘ + return`

// notice how the Chat element stays on the Glass document
// use that to chat with the bot a few times

// if you want to reset the chat to its original state, run the `Glass: reset file` command
// you can also just press `⌘ + shift + r`
