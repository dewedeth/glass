// many interesting applications of AI technology involve loading information dynamically (e.g. from an API) and giving the LLM access to this data
// in this example, let's load the raw HTML from the personal website of elliott burris
// we can load this raw HTML and inject it into the prompt — the LLM can use this HTML to answer questions

// yes, the Code block can run async code — just be sure to `await` any async calls!

<Code>
const url = "https://elliottburris.com"
const res = await fetch(url)
const htmlText = await res.text()
</Code>
