// Glass is a powerful and flexible playground to iterate on your prompts directly from VSCode
// but Glass can also be easily used from the rest of your codebase

// here's a simple prompt to extract a street address from the user's message
// it can be called from the rest of your codebase quite easily

// open up the command menu (command+shift+p) and run the `Glass: transpile current file` command
// this will transpile the Glass file to Typescript (we'll learn how to change this language later) and copy the code to your buffer
// Run the `Glass: transpile current file` command, open a new file, and paste the contents in.

// as you'll see this will generate a simple Typescript function that you can call from the rest of your codebase, just like this:
// ```ts
// Glass.e()    
// ```

// it's called `e` becuase our filename is `e.glass`.  If you change the name of this file, the Glass function will be renamed as well.

<System>
The user will provide you with a message.  Your job is to read the message and extract the street address mentioned by the user.

If the user provides you with a street address in their message, return the formatted street address.  Otherwise, return NONE.
