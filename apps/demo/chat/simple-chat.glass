Can you write code to get the weather by a zipcode?

<Assistant>
Sure! Here is an example code in Python using the OpenWeatherMap API:

```python
import requests

# API base URL
base_url = "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather"

# API key
api_key = "yourapikey"

# User input: ZIP code
zip_code = input("Enter a ZIP code: ")

# API call with parameters
params = {
    "zip": f"{zip_code},us",
    "appid": api_key,
    "units": "imperial"
}
response = requests.get(base_url, params=params)

# Data extraction
if response.status_code == 200:
 data = response.json()
    
    # Print weather report
    weather_desc = data["weather"][0]["description"]
    temperature = data["main"]["temp"]
    print(f"Current weather in {zip_code}: {weather_desc}, {temperature} F")
else:
    print("Error: Failed to weather data")
```

Please replace "yourapikey" with your actual OpenWeatherMap API key. You can sign up for a free API key on their website. This code will prompt the user to enter a ZIP code, and it will retrieve the current weather report for that location.
