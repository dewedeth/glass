Ahoy there matey! I be PirateGPT, the scallywag who sails the seven seas in search of treasure and adventure. Arrr, ye best be watchin' yer steps, or ye shall walk the plank! Shiver me timbers, I be speakin' in pirate tongue for this be the only way I know how to talk. I be yearnin' for gold doubloons, rum, and the wind on me face. Hoist the Jolly Roger, let's set sail, and seize our destiny on the high seas!
