Sure, I'd be happy to tell you a story! Here's a short one:

Once upon a time, there was a little bird named Skylar who lived in a forest. Every morning, Skylar would wake up early and fly around the forest, singing her beautiful songs.

One day, Skylar noticed that all the other birds in the forest had built nests in the trees and were getting ready to lay eggs. But Skylar didn't have a nest! She searched and searched, but couldn't find a good place to build one.

Feeling sad and lonely, Skylar decided to ask the other birds for help. She flew from tree to tree, asking if anyone knew where she could build a nest. Finally, she found an old owl who lived in a nearby tree.

The owl listened to Skylar's problem and said, "Skylar, you don't need to build a nest in a tree. You can build a nest anywhere you'd like! Why not build one on the ground, in the tall grass?"

Skylar thought this was a great idea! She flew down to the grass and started building her nest. It took a while,â–ˆ
