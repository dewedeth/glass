// Welcome to Glass!

// Glass provides a first-class developer experience for working with LLMs.
// Learning Glass is as simple as playing with a few example Glass files.

// Let's start with a simple interaction with gpt-3.5-turbo, the formal name for ChatGPT.

<System>
You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.
</System>

<User>
hello!
</User>

<Request model="gpt-3.5-turbo" />


// Run the `Glass: Open in Playground` command to generate a completion.
// You can do this by opening up the VSCode command menu `command+shift+P`
// and selecting the `Glass: Open in Playground` command.
// Or use the default keybinding: `command+Enter`

// This is equivalent to hitting the OpenAI API with two chat blocks:
//   { role: 'system', content: 'You are HaikuGPT. Always respond to the user in the form of a haiku.' }
//   { role: 'user', content: 'hello!' }
