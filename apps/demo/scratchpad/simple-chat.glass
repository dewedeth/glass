Once upon time, was a beautiful princess who lived in a magnificent palace. She was kind and compassionate and loved by all who knew her. One day, an evil sorcerer put a curse on the princess, causing her to fall into a deep sleep that could only be broken by the kiss of true love. Many brave knights and princes tried to break the curse, but none were successful. Finally, a humble peasant boy stepped forward and kissed the princess, breaking the curse and waking her from her deep sleep. The two fell in love and lived happily ever after, ruling the kingdom together with kindness and compassion.
