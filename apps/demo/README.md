# Glass demos

This folder contains examples of using Glass. The best place to start is [quickstart](./quickstart).

This folder is also used as the default workspace when launching/developing the `vscode-glass` extension; this way as you're developing Glass,
you can easily test your changes across all of the examples.

Want more information? Check out the [Glass docs](https://docs.glass).
