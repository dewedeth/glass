# Changelog

We frequently release new features and updates to Glass. See some of the changes here and stay up to date in our <a href="https://discord.gg/WBdZFBhR" class="link">Discord</a>. **Warning**: Glass is in alpha.

Minor version releases before 1.0.0 may contain breaking changes.

## Update 0.7.1

### New npm package

- `npm install --save @glass-lang/glassc` into your project;
  the transpiler output depends on it
### New output format

- The `Glass: transpile all` command will now output to a single file,
  called `glass.ts`/`glass.js`
- Configure where code gets generated via the `glass.outputDirectory`
  configuration option (default: `${workspaceFolder}/src`)
- The `Glass: transpile current file` command will copy to the clipboard
  instead of creating a file
- The transpiler is now whitespace sensitive; your prompt should have exactly
  the same whitespace you see in the Glass file

### New syntax

- Interpolation variables now use single mustache (`{}`) syntax, think of
  them just like other code expressions. Before they used double mustache
  (`{{}}`) syntax, which was needlessly different from other code expressions.
  We are still playing with this, apologies in advance for whiplash.
- Declaring interpolation arguments in frontmatter is optional; args will
  otherwise be inferred
- Glass documents may now include blocks, which look like this:

![New syntax example](./exampleImages/V0.7.1_example.png)


- Instead of a `(args) => string` function, documents with blocks produce a
  `(args) => { role: 'system' | 'user' | 'assistant': content: string }[]`
  function, which you may use for the `messages` field to the ChatGPT API
- Code expressions (e.g. `{"hello".substring(0, 3)}` or
  `{ function() { return "hello" } }`) work as before, except those declared
  in the interstitial space between blocks will be ignored as comments
- Imports work as before; relative paths will be re-written to work correctly
  if you output to a different folder than the one containing your Glass
  files
- You may still have a Glass file which contains no blocks; if so, the
  transpiled function will be `(args) => string` as before

### Extension updates

- improved syntax highlighting, with support for block syntax
- completions & diagnostics for Glass files
- code folding for blocks
- comment entire blocks via select + `Cmd + /`

### Removed features

- OpenAI client generation
- Test spec generation
