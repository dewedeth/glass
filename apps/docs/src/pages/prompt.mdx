# Types of Prompts

There are two kinds of prompts in Glass: completion prompts and chat prompts. Although they will share many capabilities



Glass can be especially helpful when writing prompts for chat interfaces, especially when it comes to cleanly handling different roles in chat prompts and building more dynamic conversation prompts.

Glass comes with built-in support for chat prompt blocks:

- `<System>` blocks allow you to designate a message with role="system"
- `<User>` blocks allow you to designate a message with role="user"
- `<Assistant>` blocks allow you to designate a message with role="assistant"

Here's an example of a chat prompt that utilizes the `<System>` and `<User>` blocks:
